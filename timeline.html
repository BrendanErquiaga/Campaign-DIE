                <p>Aided by the tree-creature, whom Tyr had kept alive as a pet, the party was lead south, deeper & deeper into the woods. Finally they came upon a clearing in front of a canyon. The canyon was engulfed in trees & foliage, as the party approached the flora came alive. The tree-folk tried to capture Tyr yet again, they seemed committed to taking the elf. This time they brought a huge tree that towered over everyone, until Tish polymorphed Tyr into a Giant Ape. </p>
                <p>A few spells & slew of thunderous punches later, the party had reduced everything in the canyon to ash & kindling. They decided to head east to rest before continuing on. However before they got very far they came upon an interesting tree. When Tyr touched the tree a set of magical doors opened up to a hollow tree. The group climbed the tree only to find themselves suddenly transported to a strange room underground. </p>
                <p>In this strange room the party finally came face to face with the strange armored man they saw a few days past. As a twist of fate the man was actually one of the last remaining elves on Denbora Island. The elf & his strange companion, Pagk, captured the party & transported them to a kitchen. Tyr’s curiosity & Cade’s unwillingness to sit still helped the group escape the kitchen through the sewers. The adventurer’s suddenly found themselves at the bottom of a dormant volcano when a three headed flying beast started to descend upon them. </p>

                <p>After arriving back at the Tower our heroes proceeded to interrogate the Hobgoblin ‘No Name’. They soon learned the Hobgoblins were building an army, & that they were being sold strange beasts by an unknown source. Another part of the expedition had also run into strange mutated animals, one such creature was a basilisk morphed with a boar. The group went deep into the forest hoping to find the source of these animals, they brought a chicken to use as bait.</p>
                <p>On their second day in the forest the party stumbled into a clearing only to be attack by several Cockatrice & a large monstrosity with several tentacles. In the chaos of the battle, Tish was petrified by one of the Cockatrice & the group left their companion as a human statue in the middle of the forest. Thankfully Tish woke up a day later, a bit stiff but otherwise free of harm.</p>
                <p>After the party met back up they returned to the forest, their search took them deep into the heart of the woods. Eventually they stumbled upon a strange tree-like creature. The creature led Tyr & the party to more tree-folk who tried to capture the elf. The party fought back & killed all of the trees & another monstrosity of plant matter.</p>

              <p>After recovering from the attack on the road our heroes made their way to the Southern Outpost. Dispatching some
              rather feckless Hobgoblins & their Owlbear, the party soon went to sleep. The next day the adventurer's went south, looking for the
              source of deforestation. On the way they discovered a roaming Hobgoblin party riding on Worgs. With quick thinking, and a few
              explosives, the adventures killed all but one of the war party, keeping Hobgoblin 'No Name' as a prisoner. They returned to the tower
              with the prisoner in tow, spotting a mysterious armor clad figure on the way.</p>

                 traveling southeast with Kadri, their half-elf guide. During the first night Kadri & two other members had some fun <i>'intiating'</i>
                 the party to the expedition. On the next day the party was attacked by Hobgoblins and Owlbears (oh my)!</p>

                Vardic, Officer of Battle, Nimrie, Officer of Survival, and Sardan, Expedition Leader.</p>
